This is the repository for the source code of the paper "Disentangled Contrastive Learning with Adaptive Resampling for Generalizable Joint Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation".

**The paper primarily investigates the "single-source domain generalization" problem for "optic cup and disc joint segmentation." The complete source code will be released upon the paper's acceptance.**
